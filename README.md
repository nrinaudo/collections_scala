collections_scala
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nrinaudo/collections_scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nrinaudo/collections_scala)

Scala implementations of various purely functional data structures I'm playing with.

This is in now way meant for production use, or for any form of use at all, really: this is purely a research / learning
project for me.

See [this project](https://github.com/nrinaudo/collections_haskell) for Haskell implementations of the same data
structures.
